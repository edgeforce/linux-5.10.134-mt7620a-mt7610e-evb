	  Allow mixed use of all hardware supported erasesizes,
	  by forcing spi_nor to use the multiple eraseregions code path.
	  For example: A 68K erase will use one 64K erase, and one 4K erase
	  on supporting hardware.

	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

	help
	  There are many flash chips that support 4K sectors, but are so large
	  that using them significantly slows down writing large amounts of
	  data or using a writable filesystem.
	  Any flash chip larger than the size specified in this option will
	  not use 4K sectors.
